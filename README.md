# 🔐 Identity Lifecycle & Security Monitoring Lab  
**IronGate Logistics (Simulated Environment)**

---

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a real-world **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** environment using Microsoft Entra ID. The lab demonstrates how organizations manage user access throughout the **Joiner–Mover–Leaver (JML)** lifecycle while also identifying and responding to security risks such as **privilege creep** and **unauthorized privilege escalation**.

IronGate Logistics is a fictional mid-sized logistics company used to simulate real-world identity and access management scenarios.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: This is a simulated lab environment created for educational and portfolio purposes. No real company data or systems were used.

# 🟢 Joiner Scenario (Onboarding)

### Objective:
Simulate onboarding a new employee using least privilege.

### Actions:
- Created user: **Sofia Martinez**
- Assigned group: **Ops-Technician**

### Validation:
- Verified group membership
- Confirmed actions in audit logs:
  - Add user
  - Add member to group

### Security Insight:
Proper onboarding ensures users receive only the access required for their role, reducing the attack surface.

# 🔵 Mover Scenario (Privilege Creep)

### Objective:
Simulate a role change and identify improper access handling.

### Actions (Incorrect):
- Promoted Carlos Mendez to Ops-Manager
- Failed to remove Ops-Technician access

### Issue Identified:
- User had multiple roles → **Privilege Creep**

### Remediation:
- Removed Ops-Technician access
- Retained only Ops-Manager role

### Validation:
- Verified corrected access
- Observed audit logs:
  - Add member to group
  - Remove member from group

### Security Insight:
Privilege creep increases risk by granting unnecessary access, which can be exploited by attackers.

# 🔴 Leaver Scenario (Offboarding)

### Objective:
Simulate secure offboarding of a user.

### Actions:
- Disabled account (Account enabled = No)
- Removed all group memberships
- Retained account for auditing

### Validation:
- Verified no access remains
- Confirmed account is blocked from sign-in

### Security Insight:
Accounts should be **disabled, not deleted**, to preserve logs and enable forensic investigations.

# 🚨 Security Incident (Privilege Escalation)

### Objective:
Simulate a potential account compromise.

### Actions:
- Added Test User to **IT-Security** (high privilege group)

### Detection:
- Identified suspicious activity in audit logs:
  - Add member to group

### Response:
- Removed user from IT-Security
- (Optional) Disabled account

### Security Insight:
Unexpected privilege escalation is a strong indicator of compromise and requires immediate investigation and containment.
